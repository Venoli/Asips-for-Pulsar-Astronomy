<h1>Asips for Pulsar Astronomy</h1>  
'Asips' is a Research cunducted for automating pulsar candidate selection. This is the API of Asips which can be used by anyone.
This implementation uses the HTRU2 dataset.

# :fire: Features

### Gaussian Hellinger Extremely Fast Decision Tree (GH-EFDT)
This is the main output of the research. GH-EFDT is a stream learning algorithm. This is an 
improviced version of Extremely Fast Decision Tree [1] for imbalanced streams. Hellinger Distance amoung 
Gaussian destributions were used as a split criterion [2] when handling the imbalanced problem.
This algorithm is suitable for candidate selection since it is,

- 1) Accurate
- 2) Not biased toward the majority class
- 3) Learn incrementally
- 4) Not Harmed by concept drift
- 5) Fast


### Other classification Algorithms
This API provide verification feature from other libraries. For now this provides,

- 1) OnlineSMOTEBaggingClassifier
- 2) OnlineUnderOverBaggingClassifier


## üõ† Installation
Clone the repository

```python
git clone https://github.com/Venoli/Asips-for-Pulsar-Astronomy.git
```
Run the Jupyter notebook inside the src folder
```python
cd src/asips
!python flask_api.py
```

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick Start

Since this is developed using Flask, the above code will start the server on http://localhost:5000/. (This will refer as BASE_URL in the below sections)

### Pretrain
Below request will pretrain the model. <br>
count: pretrain count
```python
BASE_URL/pretrain/<count>
```

### Predict
Below request will make a prediction using the model.  <br>
count: number of samples to predict
```python
BASE_URL/predict/<count>
```

### Learn from all
By below request model will learn from all of the early predictions
```python
BASE_URL/learn-from-all
```
### Learn by id
By below request model will learn from sample with given id.  <br>
id: id of the sample
```python
BASE_URL/learn/<id>
```

### Test with Another Classifier
By below request previouse predictions can be verified using another model.  <br>
model: name of the model. 
      (smoteBagging, underOverBagging)
```python
BASE_URL/test-with-other-classifier/<model>
```
